Fork of Simple Controllers build-a-box that has a push button to switch between four profiles and have the button layout to match Haxxs B0XX. 

Instructions: Press 2 times for project M, 3 times for Brawl/Smash4/Ult, and 4 for Steam generic. 

One for melee, one for PM, one for Brawl/4/Ult, and the final is for steam generic controller and I use it for monster hunter world.

This is because Melee and PM use different shield drop values / up tilt values, Brawl onwards games can't read the hard press of the GC controller and different uptilt values, and finally for steam generic I have a mode where the dpad is always enabled and the angle modifiers are removed because many modern games require the dpad. 

This code utilizes the Nicohood Library.
